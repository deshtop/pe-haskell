Project Euler solutions in Haskell
==================================

This solutions to [Project Euler][1] are an attempt to teach myself some [Haskell][2].

Therefore don't expect elegant code or good runtimes.

# Note
Since `Euler.hs` (exporting often used functions) is located above the `solutions` folder you'll have to run
        ghci filename.hs -i..
or compile
        ghc filename.hs -i..
letting GHC know where to look for `Euler.hs`
